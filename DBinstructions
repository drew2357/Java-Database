*-----------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------*
|Welcome to the shoddiest database you've ever   |
|used. The list of operational instructions is   |
|short and confusing. Buckle up, things are      |
|about to get very "non-standard".               |
|                                                |
|When the database starts up all tables in the   |
|current directory will be loaded.               |
|From here you will be invited to perform a      |
|number of operations, type one of the following |
|and press enter;                                |
|"create table"                                  |
|  (use ** to denote the end of column list,     |
|   separate column names with a new line)       |
|"create record"                                 |
|  (creates a row of a table use ** to denote    |
|   the end of entries list, separate entries    |
|   with a new line)                             |
|"show tables"                                   |
|  (display all content from all tables)         |
|"list tables"                                   |
|  (display a list of tables)                    |
|"find all"                                      |
|  (find all rows with a particular entry)       |
|"show column"                                   |
|  (show a particular column of a table)         |
|"delete saved"                                  |
|  (remove a table from the database)            |
|"move record"                                   |
|  (move a record from one table to another)     |
|"change record"                                 |
|"save tables"                                   |
|"*exit*" exits the program                      |
|                                                |
|In general *'s are used as special symbols and  |
|should be avoided, if you would like to leave   |
|an entry blank for some particular table, please|
|use the keyword "empty".                        |
|Good luck...                                    |
